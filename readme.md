# iSounds working directory

This is a dump of iSounds working directory, containing everything I've done while making it.
Heck, I was, like, 14 years old while trying to make it?
Anyway there are lots of memories connected to the project but sadly I can't go on with it anymore, since it needs too much updates, maybe a re-write from scratch. 
I didn't sort it so it comes as is. 
Neither this can be considered clean code at all. I've had totally no idea 'bout properly coding but something I thought would be a great idea for a tweak. Sadly these days it's all vice-versa :(

Maybe someone will want to pick this up.

I'm glad you still remember it.

Thanks to all of you.
These were great times.
Goodbye.
